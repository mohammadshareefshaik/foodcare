<p>Relying on sabudana (sago pearls) and potato-based dishes for Navratri fasting can get a tad boring. To make it a fun mix while keeping the festive fervour on, people who are fasting can also try a healthy dose of millets, different vegetables as well as different types of flour. With the spotlight on different kinds of indigenous millets, nutritionists and chefs have come up with interesting dishes.<br><strong>SAVOURY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FOR SNACKING</strong><br>While mostly fruits and vegetables are consumed raw during fasting, if one cares for a snack, they can be turned into lip-smacking snacks. Chef Ajay Chaudhary who has been turning different fruits and root vegetables into gourmet snacks, shares, “Raw banana, sweet potato, yams are some of the popular star ingredients for savoury snacks during fasting. Because of their potato-like texture, these can be made into yummy cutlets.”</p>

<p><strong>MILLET MIXES FOR A NEW FLAVOUR</strong><br>From pulao, khichdi, tehri to dhokla and dosa – millets are the best vrat food alternative for those who love rice. While Sama chawal (barnyard millet) remains a favourite, people also experiment with kodo, foxtail and pearl millet too. “Millets are the best guiltfree indulgence during fasts. As they have very low cholesterol, low glycemic index and are gluten-free, they can be used with almost any ingredient to make some tasty dishes,” adds Vidhi.</p>

<p><strong>CARE FOR A FALAHARI PIZZA?<br></strong>Yes, it is completely true that you can have falahari kachori or pizza while fasting! The base of the pizza is prepared using no maida and gluten-free flour. Indore-based restaurant owner Dimpy Sarda shares, “Replacing maida with singhara or rajgira ka atta is the key. Tomato is anyway considered a fruit and it has a little desi taste due to Indian herbs. One can even make tandoori paneer pizza. ”</p>

<p><strong>BUCKWHEAT, CHESTNUT AND AMARANTH FLOUR TAKES CENTERSTAGE</strong><br>Not only are these flours healthy, but they can also be used in different combinations to come up with a variety of filling dishes – right from poori, paratha to pizza. Dietician Vidhi Chawla explains how dishes made from these flours can be not only beneficial but a tasty treat for the body. “Water chestnut or Singhara as it is popularly known, is free of cholesterol and fats. It also has amazing cooling properties which is beneficial in detoxing the body during fasting. Likewise Buckwheat flour or kuttu ka atta is gluten-free and has a low glycemic index. Both of these flours can be used to whip up some satiating treats,” says Vidhi.</p>
